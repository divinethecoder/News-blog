                    <h1>Crimea bridge: How Russia is rebuilding its vital link</h1>
                    <p>
                        Satellite images show how a key bridge to the Crimean peninsula, damaged by an explosion in October in mysterious circumstances, has now been largely repaired.

                        When it was originally opened in 2018, the Kerch Bridge was hailed by Russian media as "the construction of the century", four years after Moscow illegally annexed Crimea.

                        The explosion has severely hampered Russia's ability to keep its troops supplied, having to resort to a limited ferry service across the Kerch strait.

                        It has also been a major embarrassment for President Putin, given the bridge's importance as both a strategic and symbolic project.

                    <p>
                        Repairs to the bridge had been scheduled for completion in July 2023.

                        Although not yet fully completed, construction appears to be ahead of schedule.

                        The process of clearing damage and starting repairs began shortly after the explosion on 8 October.

                        Repairs to Crimean Bridge, 8 Oct to 30 Nov 2022
                        On 8 October, an explosion destroyed several sections of one carriageway of the Crimean Bridge. A fuel train travelling on a separate bridge nearby also caught fire.Satellite imagery taken one week after the blast show construction vehicles near the damaged sections of the bridge.On 19 October, three barges carrying cranes can be seen floating near the damaged bridge sectionsAn image from 28 October show some damaged sections having been removed. The cranes appear to be loading more damaged road pieces onto barges.By 1 November, all damaged sections of the bridge have been removed.One month later, the bridge appears to have been fully repaired, with four new segments installed and fresh asphalt applied

                        Cranes on barges were floated out to the site to remove four sections of road that had collapsed or broken.

                        By the end of October, the bridge was ready for new construction.

                        During November, cloud cover made analysis via satellite images of the reconstruction impossible, but social media posts from Russian sources and regional news stories give further insight into the process.

                        Images show that pre-made sections of carriageway were carried to the damaged site on top of giant flat-bed transporters - a journey which took seven hours from the Russian coast.

                        Cranes positioned on the stable sections of bridge then laid them into place.

                    <p>
                        Finally, the new sections of carriageway were given an asphalt surface.

                        "The bridge has certainly been repaired much quicker than the timescales common in civilian engineering projects," says Dr Andrew Barr, a civil and structural engineering researcher.

                        "But the resource prioritisation involved in restoring a military and political asset changes things significantly, especially in a country at war," he adds.

                        A Kremlin video which it says shows President Putin driving across the bridge
                        President Putin made a visit to the bridge on 5 December, and the Kremlin posted a video which it says shows him driving a vehicle along the repaired section, being told about the project.

                        At one point, Mr Putin was told by a worker that traffic had been due to resume on 20 December, but that "accelerated construction" had allowed the section he was on to open sooner than that.

                        How badly was the bridge damaged?
                        The bridge carries both road and rail traffic across the Kerch strait between Russia and the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014.

                        Satellite images reveal that a blast caused sections of one of the two road carriageways to collapse into the sea, with just part of it visible above water.
